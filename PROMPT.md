# Best Recreation Prompt — Sylvia GuessMe (Static)

You are an expert engineer and UX designer.

Create a kid-friendly guessing game called **“Sylvia GuessMe”** that runs as a **static site** (GitHub Pages compatible):
- HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS only (no server)
- Character packs stored as JSON files (Minecraft, Disney, Mario)
- Player enters clues; the bot guesses a character
- Player confirms Yes/No; clues accumulate and guesses refine
- Win overlay with stars + confetti
- Score tracking (Won/Played/Best) in localStorage
- Pack selector that updates UI accent color (Minecraft green, Disney blue, Mario red)
- Responsive centered layout (mobile/tablet/desktop)

Avoid removing features when iterating; make changes additively.
